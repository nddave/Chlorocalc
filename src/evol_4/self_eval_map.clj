;;
;; Description : The idea is to take values of light intensity given to a plant (x variable) and chlorophyll generated (y variable) and to
;;               evolve a formula that models the two variables. Then use the same formula as an error function to evolve a set of values
;;               that correspond to light intensities. This list of light intensitites can then be used by green houses or farmers to automate
;;               an efficient plant growth cycle using changing light intensities.
;;
;;               The following plant is considered for the following conditions:
;;               Plant considered: Soybean plant
;;               Light intensities: Ranging from 90w/(m^2) to 220w/(m^2)
;;               Plant environment temperature: Room temperature maintained at 22*C

{:attendance "I have attended all my classes. I have interacted with my peers as well"
 :code "The program takes values of light intensity given to a plant (x variable) and chlorophyll generated (y variable) and to evolve a formula that models the two variables. Then use the same formula as an error function to evolve a set of values that correspond to light intensities."
 :results "The result is a set of light intensities that can be used by green houses or farmers to automate the process of efficient chlorophyll generation in plant growth."
 :presentation "I presented the functioning of the code. How it evolved light intensities and correlation formulas, each step was shown and the code was functional."
 :knowledge "I learnt how to creatively use the methods of evolutionary computing, and apply it to various different areas and different fields. Such as plant biology!"}
